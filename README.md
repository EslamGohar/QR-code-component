## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I tried to use css unit (rem) which means that the root element's font-size (html).
If you change the <html> element's font-size in the CSS you will see that everything else changes relative to it
like 'rem' unit.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
html {
   font-size: 62.5%;
}

body { 
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%)
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to make my own QR code generator. so, this could be used as a default template.\
The QR code could be links to a document or something along. Going to think about something useful that could come in handy.
